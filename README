Required libraries:
Keras
Keras-rl
matplotlib
numpy

To run:

Place both game.py and learning.py within the same directory.

To run the neural network training:
python3 learning.py

To play the game:
python3 game.py 

Both will ask you what field design to use, your options are:
-1: Random, randomly generates a field design for each game to play 
0: Empty, an empty board with no walls
1: Walls, an board with walls along the edges
2: Cross, a board with a cross design in the middle
4: Random small blocks, randomly place a number of walls in the field
8: Random small holes, randomly remove a number of placed walls

These options may be ORed together to combine them (Excluding the random option).
game.py will also ask for the field size, view size, and print type.
learning.py by default uses a 10 by 10 field.
